    "The Common Voice dataset is an open-source collection of voice recordings contributed by volunteers from around the world. Created by Mozilla, it includes transcribed speech data in dozens of languages and accents, making it one of the largest multilingual datasets available for training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The dataset is freely available under the CC-0 license, encouraging both academic and commercial use. It aims to support inclusive and diverse voice technology by representing different accents, demographics, and speaking styles.\n",

Subset contains 16,372 samples, with a total size of 672 MB. Since currently I am only using the data for testing, this will help speeding up the process and minimize the needed resources.

    "\n",
    "- **Sourced from**<br>\n",
    "    Volunteers are free to contibute by recording themselves reading public domain (CC0) sentences in their languages and accents. The public domain (CC0) sentences typically sourced from:\n",
    "    - Wikipedia\n",
    "    - Public domain books\n",
    "    - Government websites\n",
    "    - News articles\n",
    "    - User-submitted content\n",
    "    - Other public domain sources\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Typical Topics**<br>\n",
    "    Technology, Science, Weather, History, Education, Geography, Daily Life, Health, Transportation, etc.\n",
    "- **Contains huge, and an unbalanced variety of accents and supports a lot of languages**<br>\n",
    "    - Supports 137 different language\n",
    "    - A single sample can have multiple accents because speakers self-report their accent(s), and the system allows tagging multiple — even if not all are equally reflected in each recording.\n",
    "    - Illustrative Example: A bilingual speaker raised in different regions might reflect a mix.\n",
    "- **Noise**<br>\n",
    "    The Common Voice dataset intentionally includes a variety of real-world background noises to make automatic speech recognition (ASR) more robust.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The accepted noises might include:\n",
    "    - Traffic noise\n",
    "    - Indoor chatter or distant conversations\n",
    "    - Household sounds (TV, cooking, machinery)\n",
    "    - Quiet background music\n",
    "    - Natural ambient sounds (birds, wind, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The unaccepted noises might include:\n",
    "    - Excessive loud background noise\n",
    "    - Overlapping conversations interfering with the clip\n",
    "    - Cracking, distortion, static, or dropouts that obscure speech \n",
    "- **Censorship**<br>\n",
    "    - Sentences are reviewed and curated\n",
    "    - No hate speech, obscenity, or private data is allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Clip Duration**<br>\n",
    "    The average clip duration is approximatly 5s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Some Issues To Consider**\n",
    "- **capitalization:** Not all sentences contain correct capitalization. For example:<br>\n",
    "    - A sentence starts with a capital letter in: common_voice_en_18276812.mp3 : \"What a strange mauve colour!\"\n",
    "    - But here it doesn't: common_voice_en_93276.mp3 : \"a boy enjoys a rain shower.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    More serious example where all leters are written in capitals: <br>\n",
    "    - common_voice_en_572372.mp3 : \"YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues are serious, and will affect the models predictions. Thus, I will need to deal with them as will be shown later.\n",
    "\n",

    "The dataset contains 16,372 samples, each sample contains the following values:\n",
    "- **path:** contains the audio file name correspnding to this sample. For example, common_voice_en_57.mp3\n",
    "- **audio:** This is a dictionary contains three values:\n",
    "    - **path:** The absolute path to the corresponding audio file\n",
    "    - **array:** An array of floats representing the loadede corresponding audio file\n",
    "    - **sampling_rate:** The sampling rate of the corresponding audio file\n",
    "- **sentence:** Transcription\n",
    "- **up_votes:** Total number of up votes made by reviewers\n",
    "- **down_votes:** Total number of down votes made by reviewers\n",
    "- **age:** Contributer's age\n",
    "- **gender:** Contributer's gender\n",
    "- **accents:** Contributer's accents<br>\n",
    "    As previously mentioned:\n",
    "    - A single sample can have multiple accents because speakers self-report their accent(s), and the system allows tagging multiple — even if not all are equally reflected in each recording\n",
    "    - Illustrative Example: A bilingual speaker raised in different regions might reflect a mix\n",
    "- **locale:** The language code of the audio sample, such as en for English, and et for Estonian\n",
    "- **segment:** marks whether a clip belongs to a specific special-purpose sub-corpus beyond the main dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The following values, path, audio, sentence, up_votes, and down_votes always have values, while the rest might be empty sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers can check the samples and vote for each one, either up, indicating that the transcription is correct, or down, indicating that the transcription is incorrect or the clip has poor quality. All the samples in this dataset had more up votes than the down votes at least by a value of 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### But this function is not totaly ready yet, it only works with one word, if you tried to use it with a full sentence, then the spelling doesn't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Combine With Compose**\n",
    "```Python\n",

    "## **5️⃣ Evaluation Metrics** <a id=\"evaluation-metrics\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### I am using only one metric since it does the job perfectly and I got no more time to spend on such details. The metric Is called Word Error Rate (WER), which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. It measures how accurately a system transcribes spoken language into text by comparing the system's output to a correct version (reference). WER is particularly useful because it provides a straightforward, interpretable score: the lower the WER, the better the transcription quality. This metric accounts for various types of errors, including incorrect words, missing words, and extra words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The formula for WER is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$\\text{WER} = \\frac{S + D + I}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where:\n",
    "#### - S = the number of substitutions (wrong words),\n",
    "#### - D = the number of deletions (missing words),\n",
    "#### - I = the number of insertions (extra words),\n",
    "#### - N = the total number of words in the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This equation essentially calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the hypothesis into the reference, normalized by the total number of words in the reference. WER can exceed 1.0 (or 100%) if the number of errors is greater than the number of reference words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I won't implement this my self, instead, I'll use a very simply and useful function as follows:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from jiwer import wer\n",
    "\n",
